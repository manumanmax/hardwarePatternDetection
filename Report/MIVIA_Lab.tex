 \par Except theaching computer sciences, doctors of the lab work on pattern recognition, classification, media analysis and many parallele subjects like autonomus drones and robot vision.
 \par The laboratory is directed by Mario Vento. He is assisted by Alessia Saggese. Pasquale Foggia, Gennaro Percannella and Pierluigi Ritrovato (who is also my tutor). They all are teachers and researchers for the lab. There are also several students and graduated that work on thesis for the laboratory. I was more in contact with Antonio Greco and Raffaele Iuliano. All students and graduated was working on differents projects and start-ups and the laboratory itself works for and with international companies.
 \par You can find all of this information on their website at this address : \url{http://mivia.unisa.it/}
 \par Because of the opportunity of double diploma, the proximity with France, the possibility to learn a new language even if we spoke english between us. I was really optimistic about the place and the laboratory.
	 
 \section{Place and life in Italy}
 
 \par The first month of internship, I lived in Carpineto, 25 minutes to the university by foot. It was envoying the view on the montains in the morning and the evening but when I wanted to move during the week-ends, buses didn't pass near my flat so that I had easily hours of walk to get back home. I moved on to Salerno, in the old town. Than it was easier to move the week-ends. 
 \par The main tourstic place around is the Amalfitan coast which is beautiful. There is also Napoli and Pompei which are respectivelly a big harbor and internatially know touristic place. Globally it is a really nice place where you can have snow in the winter and 33 degrees during weeks in the summer.

 \par In the picture~\ref{amalfi} of Amlfi there is nowone, but in july, it becomes overcrowded because of tourism. Also, I found that this part of Italy is really human. It feels like you can trust people really quickly because they are really sympathic. That is suprising when you come from France and it requires a thousand of documents to get a flat. In Salerno, the ID card is enough. People are always happy but a bit slow sometimes.
 I took advantage of the intership to make a lot of trekking in the amalfitan coast and around Fisciano. Visite ruins, Napoli and see a lot of churches because christianism is really present in Italy.
