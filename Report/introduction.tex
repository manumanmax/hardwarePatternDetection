\chapter{Introduction}

\par During the second year of engineering school at ENSICAEN we have to realize a 3-month internship that I decided to do in the MIVIA Lab of Salerno's university in Italy. They are specialized in image synthesis, which is my major course, moreover, I am interested in a double diploma in this university which gives me the opportunity to see the place and teachers, learn the Italian and make some contacts.
\par My internship subject has been divided in two. First a study on the Motorola HC1 helmet, used, for exemple, in the military field. The aim was to see if we could compile Linux for the helmet and install it on. Then, develop an application capable of recognizing patterns in an image and store the position, the number of patterns found and the type of each pattern. So as to determine the name of a global structure which the patterns are components.
\par In this report I will present the laboratory and the place of the internship, the study of the hardware for the helmet and the software (OpenCV mainly) for the application. What exists and where my projects are situated in their environments. After that I explain what I tried to solve the problems and what are the results.
