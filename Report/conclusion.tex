\chapter{Conclusion}
%\lastpageref*{LastPages}

\par To conclude, I am really happy of my internship. Even if the first project went wrong, I learned that sometimes we have to stop before we waste our time. I appreciated the location and the communication between Pierluigi and me. I felt followed and supported during the most important phases of the project. That was both motivating and reassuring.
\par I learned a lot about compilation, that will be really useful for the next libraries I will install. OpenCV gave me a good idea of how far we can go with image analysis. It gave me ideas for future projects and I proved myself that I am capable of achieving a project. I also improved my English and learn a little bit of Italian. 
\par Of course, being in a foreign country was an exceptional experience. Every day was a new opportunity to make discoveries and see how other people live. Now I know that in the middle of an unknown country, I will have the better reflexes and I can find my way.
\par In addition to all of that, I am now sure that a double diploma really is my idea of the last year of my studies. I had doubts about it, but now I am sure that I want to move in different countries in my future work.
\par For all these reasons I want to thank again all the persons who help me to realize this internship.
