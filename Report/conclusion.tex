\par To conclued I am really happy of my internship. Even if the first project went wrong, I learnd that sometimes we have to stop before we waste our time. I appriciated the location and the communication between Pierluigi and me. I felt followed and supported during the most important phases of the project. That was both motivating and rasuring.
\par I learned a lot about compilation, that will be really usefull for the next libraries I will install. OpenCV gave me a good idea of how far we can go with image analysis. It gave me ideas for future project and I proved myself that I am capable of realize a project. I also improved my english and learn a little bit of italian. 
\par Of course being in a foreign country was an exceptionnal experience. Everyday was a new opportunity to make discoveries and see how other people live. Now I know that in the middle of a unkown country, I will have the good relfexes and I can find my way.
\par In addition to all of that, I am now sure that a double diploma really is my idea of the last year of my studies. I had doubts about it, but now I am almost sure that I want to move in different countries in my future work.
\par For all this reasons I want to thank again all the persons who help me to realize this internship.
