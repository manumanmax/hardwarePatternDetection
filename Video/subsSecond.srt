1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Recognize multiple patterns example

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,250
Test the MI unit with the tester

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
precise the number of patterns to find

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,750
Then it computes a range of threshold values

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,800
The 4 patterns are found in black

6
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,050
You can see the threshold value (193) on top

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,300
Now we do the same for the power_supply

8
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,950
There is only one in the image

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
The power supply is isolated

10
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,450
with a threshold of 118

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Now we can run the program

12
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,950
With the good values

13
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
And we have

14
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,950
both the power supply

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
and the MI units

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To help you to find an appropriated threshold
