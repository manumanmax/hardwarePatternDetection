1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Recognize multiple patterns example

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,250
Test the MI unit with the tester

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Precise the number of patterns to find

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,750
Then it computes a range of threshold values

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,800
The 4 patterns are found in black

6
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,050
Each line is a match

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
between the pattern

8
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,550
in left and the scene

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,300
8 match is the minimum

10
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,550
to detect a pattern

11
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,150
You can see the threshold value (193) on top

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
Now we do the same for the power_supply

13
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,650
There is only one in the image

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The power supply is isolated

15
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,450
with a threshold of 118

16
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Now we can run the program

17
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,950
With the good values

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then we have

19
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,050
both the power supply

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,200
and the MI units

21
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,750
And here all the corners and names

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To help you to find an appropriated threshold
