1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Right : pattern
Left : Scene 30cm

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,750
Test on basic values

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
To check if we have good results

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
A pattern was found

5
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,350
Let's try with a medium values (400-150)

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,100
The pattern has been correctly found

7
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,750
Now with 3 pattern on the scene

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,600
One native

9
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,350
One moved

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,100
One scaled and moved

11
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,050
On the left, type and coordonnates of the componants found
